    <p>
      AutoMan is the first fully automatic <em>crowdprogramming</em> system. AutoMan integrates human-based ("crowdsourced") computations into a standard programming language as ordinary function calls that can be intermixed freely with traditional functions. This abstraction lets  programmers focus on their programming logic. An AutoMan program specifies a <em>confidence level</em> for the overall computation and a <em>budget</em>. The AutoMan runtime system then transparently manages all details necessary for scheduling, pricing, and quality control. AutoMan automatically schedules human tasks for each computation until it achieves the desired confidence level; monitors, reprices, and restarts human tasks as necessary; and maximizes parallelism across human workers while staying under budget.
    </p>
    <p>
      AutoMan is available as a library for Scala.

  <h1 id="installation" class="page-header">Getting AutoMan</h1>

  <p>
    The easiest way to get AutoMan is via the Maven Central Repository.  If you're using SBT:
  </p>
  <pre><code>libraryDependencies += "edu.umass.cs" %% "automan" % "1.1.7"</code></pre>
  <p>
    <em>or</em> if you're using Maven:</p>
    
<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;edu.umass.cs&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;automan_2.11&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.7&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>
    Sorry, we no longer support Scala 2.10 as AutoMan requires Java 8.

  <h1 id="usage" class="page-header">Using AutoMan</h1>
  <p>In your source file, import the Mechanical Turk adapter (Scala syntax):</p>
  <pre><code>import edu.umass.cs.automan.adapters.mturk._</code></pre>
  <p>After that, initialize the AutoMan runtime with an MTurk config:</p>
  <pre><code>val a = MTurkAdapter { mt =&gt;
    mt.access_key_id = "my key"
    mt.secret_access_key = "my secret"
    mt.sandbox_mode = true
}</code></pre>
  <p>and then define your tasks:</p>
  <pre><code>def which_one() = a.RadioButtonQuestion { q =&gt;
    q.budget = 8.00
    q.text = "Which one of these does not belong?"
    q.options = List(
      a.Option('oscar, "Oscar the Grouch"),
      a.Option('kermit, "Kermit the Frog"),
      a.Option('spongebob, "Spongebob Squarepants"),
      a.Option('cookie, "Cookie Monster"),
      a.Option('count, "The Count")
    )
}</code></pre>
  <p>You may then call <code>which_one</code> just like an ordinary function (which it is).  Note that AutoMan functions immediately return an <code>Outcome</code>, but continue to execute asynchronously in the background.</p>
  <p>To access return values, you must pattern-match on the <code>Outcome</code>, e.g.,</p>
  <pre><code>val outcome = which_one()

// ... do some other stuff ...

// then, when you want answers ...
val answer = outcome.answer match {
  case Answer(value, _, _) =&gt; value
  case _ =&gt; throw new Exception("Oh no!")
}</code></pre>
  <p>Other possible <code>AbstractAnswer</code> types are <code>LowConfidenceAnswer</code> if you run out of money during a computation (which gives you access to lower-confidence results), or <code>OverBudgetAnswer</code> in case even low-confidence answers are not possible because you didn't have enough money in your budget to begin with.</p>
  <h3 id="cleanup" class="page-header">Cleaning up AutoMan Resources</h3>
  <p>Note that, due to AutoMan's design, you must explicitly shut it down, otherwise it will continue to execute indefinitely and your program will hang:</p>
  <pre><code>a.close()</code></pre>
  <p>Alternately, you may wrap your program in an <code>automan</code> statement, and cleanup will happen automatically.  This feature was <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/yh598w02%28v=vs.100%29.aspx">inspired</a> by the C# <code>using</code> statement:</p>
  <pre><code>automan(a) {
        ... your program ...
}</code></pre>
  <p>We will add more documentation to this site in the near future.  In the interim, please see the collection of sample programs in the <code>apps</code>
  directory.</p>

  <h3 id="different_backends" class="page-header">Using AutoMan with a Different Crowdsourcing Backend</h3>
  <p>We currently only support Amazon's Mechanical Turk.  However, AutoMan
  was designed to accommodate arbitrary backends.  If you are interested
  in seeing your crowdsourcing platform supported, please contact us.</p>
  <h3 id="usage" class="page-header">Automatic Memoization</h3>
  <p>AutoMan saves all intermediate human-computed results by default.  You may turn this feature off by setting <code>logging = LogConfig.NO_LOGGING</code> in your AutoMan config.  You may also set the location of the database with <code>database_path = "/path/to/your/database"</code>.</p>

  <h1 id="building" class="page-header">Building the JAR Yourself</h2>
  <p>This release incorporates an SBT build script that can build the AutoMan JAR
  for you, including downloading all of AutoMan's dependencies.  The build
  script can also build the sample applications that are located in the
  <code>apps</code> directory.  These applications are the ones used in our paper.</p>
  <p>You can build the AutoMan JAR using the following commands:</p>
  <pre><code>cd libautoman
sbt pack</code></pre>
  <p>The AutoMan JAR plus all of its dependencies will then be found in the
  <code>libautoman/target/pack/lib/</code> folder.</p>
</section>
<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="sample_applications" class="page-header">Sample Applications</h1>
  <p>Sample applications can be found in the <code>apps</code> directory.  Apps can also be built using <code>pack</code>.  E.g.,</p>
  <pre><code>cd apps/simple_program
  sbt pack
  </code></pre>
  <p>Unix/DOS shell scripts for running the programs can then be found in <code>apps/[the app]/target/pack/bin/</code>.</p>

  <p>There are two versions of the original AutoMan paper, a shortened Research Highlight that appeared in the June 2016 issue of the Communications of the ACM and a longer version that appeared at OOPSLA '12.  You should probably start with the CACM version which has a bit more polish and some updated results.</p>
